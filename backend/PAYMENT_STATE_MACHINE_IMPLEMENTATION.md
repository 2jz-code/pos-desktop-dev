## 🎯 Overview

Phase 3 transforms the payment system from an implicit, hard-to-track state management approach to an explicit, validated state machine. This implementation:

1. **Centralizes State Transitions**: All payment status changes go through validated transition methods
2. **Makes Payment the Single Source of Truth**: Order.payment_in_progress is replaced with Payment.status
3. **Provides Clear State Validation**: Invalid state transitions are prevented and logged
4. **Maintains Backward Compatibility**: Legacy methods are preserved during transition

## 🔄 State Transition Map

The formal state transition map defines all valid transitions for `Payment.PaymentStatus`:

```python
VALID_TRANSITIONS = {
    Payment.PaymentStatus.UNPAID: [
        Payment.PaymentStatus.PENDING,
        Payment.PaymentStatus.PARTIALLY_PAID,
        Payment.PaymentStatus.PAID,
    ],
    Payment.PaymentStatus.PENDING: [
        Payment.PaymentStatus.UNPAID,
        Payment.PaymentStatus.PARTIALLY_PAID,
        Payment.PaymentStatus.PAID,
    ],
    Payment.PaymentStatus.PARTIALLY_PAID: [
        Payment.PaymentStatus.PAID,
        Payment.PaymentStatus.PARTIALLY_REFUNDED,
        Payment.PaymentStatus.REFUNDED,
    ],
    Payment.PaymentStatus.PAID: [
        Payment.PaymentStatus.PARTIALLY_REFUNDED,
        Payment.PaymentStatus.REFUNDED,
    ],
    Payment.PaymentStatus.PARTIALLY_REFUNDED: [
        Payment.PaymentStatus.REFUNDED,
    ],
    Payment.PaymentStatus.REFUNDED: [],  # Terminal state
}
```

## 🛠️ New PaymentService Methods

### Core State Transition Methods

#### `initiate_payment_attempt(order: Order, **kwargs) -> Payment`

- **Purpose**: Initiates a payment attempt for an order
- **Transition**: UNPAID → PENDING
- **Validation**: Only allows transition from UNPAID status
- **Returns**: Payment object in PENDING status

#### `confirm_successful_transaction(transaction: PaymentTransaction, **kwargs) -> Payment`

- **Purpose**: Confirms a successful transaction and updates parent Payment status
- **Transitions**: PENDING → PARTIALLY_PAID or PAID (based on amount)
- **Handles**: Order completion when fully paid
- **Returns**: Updated Payment object

#### `record_failed_transaction(transaction: PaymentTransaction, **kwargs) -> Payment`

- **Purpose**: Records a failed transaction and updates Payment status
- **Transitions**: PENDING → UNPAID (if no other successful payments)
- **Handles**: Cleanup of failed payment attempts
- **Returns**: Updated Payment object

#### `cancel_payment_process(payment: Payment, **kwargs) -> Payment`

- **Purpose**: Explicitly handles payment process cancellation
- **Actions**: Cancels all pending transactions
- **Transitions**: Based on remaining successful payments
- **Returns**: Updated Payment object

### Helper Methods

#### `_validate_transition(current_status: str, target_status: str) -> bool`

- Validates if a state transition is allowed
- Uses the VALID_TRANSITIONS map
- Returns True/False for validation

#### `_transition_payment_status(payment: Payment, target_status: str, force: bool = False) -> Payment`

- Safely transitions a payment to a new status with validation
- Logs all state transitions
- Can force transitions for backward compatibility

#### `_recalculate_payment_amounts(payment: Payment) -> Payment`

- Recalculates gross paid and refunded amounts
- Updates payment.amount_paid field
- Separated from status logic for clarity

#### `_handle_payment_completion(payment: Payment)`

- Handles business logic when payment is completed
- Updates order status to COMPLETED
- Emits payment_completed signal

## 🔗 API View Updates

### CreateTerminalIntentView

**Before**: Directly called `PaymentService.create_terminal_payment_intent`
**After**:

1. Calls `PaymentService.initiate_payment_attempt(order)` first
2. Then creates the payment intent
3. Ensures proper state transition UNPAID → PENDING

### CaptureTerminalIntentView

**Before**: Called `PaymentService.capture_terminal_payment` which handled everything internally
**After**:

1. Finds the transaction
2. Calls strategy to capture with provider
3. Uses `PaymentService.confirm_successful_transaction(transaction)` for state management
4. More explicit and testable flow

## 📡 Webhook Handler Updates

### StripeWebhookView.\_handle_payment_intent_succeeded

**Before**:

- Set transaction status manually
- Called `PaymentService._update_payment_status`

**After**:

- Updates card details separately
- Uses `PaymentService.confirm_successful_transaction(transaction)`
- Cleaner separation of concerns

### StripeWebhookView.\_handle_failure

**Before**:

- Set transaction status manually
- Called `PaymentService._update_payment_status`

**After**:

- Updates provider response first
- Uses appropriate state transition method:
  - `PaymentService.cancel_payment_process()` for canceled payments
  - `PaymentService.record_failed_transaction()` for failed payments

## 🔄 Deprecation of payment_in_progress

### Order Model Changes

- **Removed**: `payment_in_progress = models.BooleanField(default=False)`
- **Added**: `payment_in_progress_derived` property that checks `Payment.status == PENDING`
- **Migration**: Created `0003_remove_payment_in_progress_field.py`

### Serializer Updates

- **OrderListSerializer**: Now uses `SerializerMethodField` with `get_payment_in_progress()`
- **Returns**: `obj.payment_in_progress_derived` instead of the field value
- **Backward Compatible**: Frontend receives the same data structure

### Admin Interface Updates

- **List Display**: Uses `get_payment_in_progress_display()` method instead of field
- **Filters**: Removed `payment_in_progress` from list_filter
- **Fieldsets**: Shows derived status as read-only information
- **Method**: Added boolean display method for admin interface

### View Updates

All views now use:

- `order.payment_in_progress_derived` instead of `order.payment_in_progress`
- Removed manual setting of the field (handled automatically by state machine)

## 🧪 Testing and Verification

### System Checks

✅ `python manage.py check` - No issues identified
✅ `python manage.py migrate` - Migration successful

### State Transition Validation

- All transitions validated against VALID_TRANSITIONS map
- Invalid transitions raise ValueError with clear messages
- State changes logged for debugging

### Backward Compatibility

- Legacy `_update_payment_status` method preserved with force=True transitions
- Frontend receives same data structure for `payment_in_progress`
- Existing payment flows continue to work

## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### Before: Implicit State Management

```python
# Scattered throughout views and services
order.payment_in_progress = True
order.save()

# Later...
transaction.status = "SUCCESSFUL"
payment = _update_payment_status(payment)  # Complex internal logic
order.payment_in_progress = False
order.save()
```

### After: Explicit State Machine

```python
# Clear, validated state transitions
payment = PaymentService.initiate_payment_attempt(order)
# ... provider interaction ...
payment = PaymentService.confirm_successful_transaction(transaction)
# All status updates handled internally with validation
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Centralized Control**: All payment state changes go through validated methods
2. **Clear Audit Trail**: Every state transition is logged
3. **Prevented Invalid States**: Transition validation prevents impossible states
4. **Single Source of Truth**: Payment.status drives all payment-related status
5. **Easier Testing**: Explicit methods are easier to unit test
6. **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid transitions

### Event-Driven Architecture

- Maintains signal-based updates for order status
- PaymentService emits `payment_completed` signal
- Order status automatically updated through signals
- Decoupled components for better maintainability

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

This state machine foundation enables:

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**: State transition logging can be extended for analytics
2. **Webhook Retry Logic**: Failed state transitions can trigger retry mechanisms
3. **Audit Compliance**: Full payment state history for regulatory requirements
4. **A/B Testing**: Different payment flows can be tested with state validation
5. **Advanced Workflows**: Complex payment scenarios (installments, holds, etc.)
